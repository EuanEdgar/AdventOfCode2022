This repo contains my solutions to [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022).

## Serve
Run any server from the root of the project.  

### PHP server example
```sh
php -S localhost:4000
```

## Run
Run the code for a given day by visiting `/[day number]/part[part number].html`.
For example, `/2/part1.html` will load the code for day 2, part 1.


## Folder setup
Run `./setup.sh [day number]` to set up a template folder for the specified day's problem.

### Example
For day 4:
```sh
./setup.sh 4
```

This creates a folder named `4` with script files for parts 1 and 2, and a file for the input.
